## Action

The action contains the logic to handle the request and produce a response. Each 
action is based on a class and can have specific parameters. Fusio contains 
already some actions for common tasks i.e. to execute database operations or 
push data to a message queue. It is also possible to provide a custom 
implementation. Please take a look at the `adapter` chapter for more 
information how to build a custom implementation.
